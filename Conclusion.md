This project really was the ultimate capstone to the course. Throughout this project we were able to experience cleaning and wrangling a large dataset, building various prediction models from the Yelp database, and learning a lot about the ins-and-outs of Matrix Factorization. While none our models did significantly better than our first baseline model, it was still a valuable learning experience and the built models performed better than pure chance alone. Ultimately, two of the models (Majority vote and Matrix Factorization) did better than our baseline model when evaluated on the test set. 

Throughout this project we built a total five different models - a baseline model, regularized linear models,  matrix factorization, KNN, and an ensemble model. All of these models tended to have accuracy rates on the test sets are 0.37. In particular, the testing accuracies for each of the different models were 0.389 for the baseline, 0.382 for Ridge, 0.364 for the Lasso, 0.324 for the KNN, 0.396 for matrix factorization, 0.404 for majority vote, and 0.357 for the Logistic ensemble. Of these models, it would appear that majority vote is the best type model to predict unknown ratings. It might be best equipped to handle some of the smaller idiosyncrasies with some of the models.  

We definitely ran into some troubles along the way as well, in particular around matrix factorization. The theory behind it was a little difficult to wrap our heads around, and determining how to create a train/test split and predict on new users was challenging to grasp. However, after it ended up performing very well when compared to other models. It had a very high training accuracy of 0.6136 and the second highest testing accuracy of 0.396. It really interesting how this method can translate so well into making recommendations of not only similar restaurants in this case, but also movies in the case of the Netflix challenge. It was incredibly computationally expensive and time consuming, so we werenâ€™t able to really flesh out as much as we hoped, but it still performed very well using our methods. 

If we had more time to really flesh out this project, we would spend more time on the matrix factorization portion. Based on the results it definitely shows promise to be very successful in recommending restaurants and predicting unknown outcomes. However, we underestimated the amount of the time with would take to actually compute a factorization. We limited ourselves to 4 latent factors and really didn't have the time to fully flesh out cross validation sizes. Future work should look into optimizing our code to improve efficiency and really push the amount of latent factors to include. Doing so may boost matrix factorization to be the most successful. Expanding on matrix factorization, we were also facing significant difficulties including it in our ensemble method. We would like to explore this issue further to see if it had a large impact on an ensemble method. Further time could also be spent on really visualizing more of our data to make the website more appealing. 

In the end, this was definitely a worthwhile experience that taught us much about recommender systems. As recommender systems are so prevalent in many of the common resources we use today, including but definitely not limited to Yelp and Netflix, we were excited to delve into the topic and look forward to exploring the realm more in the future.
